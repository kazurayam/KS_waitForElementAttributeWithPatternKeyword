# [Katalon Studio] Custom Keyword: waitForElementAttributeWithPattern

This is a small Katalon Studio project for demonstration purpose. You can download the zip from
the [Releases](https://github.com/kazurayam/KS_waitForElementAttributeWithPatternKeyword/releases) page,
unzip it, open it using your local Katalon Studio.

This project presents a custom keyword named `waitForElementAttributeWithPattern`, which is designed
to wait for an attribute of an HTML element to become present for a given timeout seconds while trying to match the attribute's value with a Regular expression.

This custom keyword was ispired by the discussion in a topic in the Katalon user forum:
